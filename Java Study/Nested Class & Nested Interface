Nested Class and Nested Inheritance
  -	Nested Class
    o	Member class – Class that is declared inside the class
      	Instance Member class
        •	class that is declared without static keyword
    o	Can declare instance field, and method
    o	Cannot declare static field or methods
      	Static member class
        •	Class that is declared with static keyword
    o	Can declare all of properties of fields and methods
    o	Local Class – Class that is declared insdie the method
      	Cannot use pulbic, private or static
      	Can only be used inside the method.
    o	When using outsie class’s method from inside class, use Outsider.this.field/method
  -	Nested Interface
    o	Interface inside a class
    o	Can have only public and default access specifiers when declared outside any other class.
  -	Anonymous Inner class
    o	Inner class without a name and for which only a single object is created. Can be useful when making an instance of an object with certain “extras” such as overloading methods of a class or interface, without having to actually subclass a class.
    o	Useful in writing implementation classes for listener interfaces in graphics programming.
      	3 ways to use it
        •	(In field)
        •	Person field = new Person(){
              void work(){System.out.println(“…”);
              #Override
              void wake(){
                System.out.println(“…”);
                work();
              }
           };
        •	Create in local method
        •	Give as a parameter.
    o	Can be used similar way to interface as well, except the programmer have to implement all abstract method when declaring anonymous class.
